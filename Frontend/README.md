# 🔐 Vaulty — Frontend

> **Save consistently. Grow your wealth. Unlock financial opportunities.**

This is the **web frontend** for Vaulty, a non-custodial decentralized savings platform built on the Stellar network. This package (`Frontend/`) is the Next.js + React application that gives users a gamified, visually rewarding interface for saving, tracking streaks, and managing their wealth — all while their funds remain in their own Stellar wallet.

This README covers the frontend workspace only. For contract and backend details, see the root `README.md` and the `Contract/` and `Backend/` workspace docs.

## What Is Currently Implemented

The current codebase is a **Phase 1 scaffold**. The following are wired up and functional:

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Next.js App Router shell | ✅ Implemented |
| Tailwind CSS styling | ✅ Implemented |
| TypeScript types (`src/types/`) | ✅ Implemented |
| Zustand client state store (`src/stores/`) | ✅ Implemented |
| `useWallet` hook (connect / disconnect flow + error states) | ✅ Implemented |
| `useVault` hook (create / deposit / withdraw against local state) | ✅ Implemented |
| `ApiClient` (`src/lib/api.ts`) — fiat deposit/withdrawal via backend | ✅ Implemented |
| `WalletManager` (`src/lib/stellar.ts`) — scaffold with stubs | ✅ Scaffold only — wallet connection and transaction signing throw `"not yet implemented"` |
| Jest + Testing Library unit tests | ✅ Implemented |

### Roadmap features (not yet implemented)

The following features exist as structural placeholders (empty feature folders, type definitions, or stub functions). They are **not functional in the current build** and should remain gated by feature flags before release:

- Actual Stellar wallet connection (requires a Stellar-compatible wallet SDK integration)
- On-chain Soroban contract calls for vault creation, deposits, and streak verification
- Nigerian bank deposit / withdrawal via anchor partner (backend integration in progress)
- Yield vaults, lending marketplace, borrow-against-savings, investment portfolios
- Saving streaks + savings calendar UI
- Achievement system and Discipline Score
- Smart notifications
- Vault pulse animations and milestone celebrations

See the root `README.md` Roadmap section for the phase-by-phase delivery plan.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm 9+ (bundled with Node.js 18)

### Install dependencies

```bash
# From inside the Frontend/ directory:
npm install
```

### Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and fill in values for your environment. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below.

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Common mistake:** `npm dev` is not a valid npm command. Use `npm run dev`.

### Other available scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Next.js development server |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run start` | Start the production server (requires `build` first) |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run type-check` | Run `tsc --noEmit` to type-check without emitting files |
| `npm test` | Run Jest unit tests once |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run Jest in watch mode |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run Jest and generate a coverage report in `coverage/` |

---

## Environment Variables

All frontend environment variables are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` so they are inlined at build time and available in the browser. **Do not put secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables** — they are exposed to the client.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK` | No | `testnet` | Which Stellar network to target (`testnet` or `mainnet`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_HORIZON_URL` | No | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` | Horizon API endpoint for the selected network |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | No | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` | Soroban RPC endpoint for contract reads (used once contract integration is implemented) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL` | Yes | `http://localhost:8000/api` | Base URL of the Vaulty backend API (required for fiat deposit/withdrawal flows) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_NETWORK` | No | `testnet` | Network identifier passed to the wallet connector (mirrors `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_LENDING` | No | `false` | Feature flag — set to `true` only when the lending UI is ready for your environment |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_BORROWING` | No | `false` | Feature flag — set to `true` only when the borrow-against-savings UI is ready |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_INVESTMENTS` | No | `false` | Feature flag — gate investments until Phase 3 post-legal-review (see root README) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | No | `http://localhost:3000` | Canonical URL of the app (used for internal links and Open Graph metadata) |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for local development. Never commit `.env.local` to version control.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run in watch mode (re-runs on file save)
npm run test:watch

# Generate HTML + lcov coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

Coverage output is written to `Frontend/coverage/`. The report covers:

- `src/hooks/` — `useWallet`, `useVault`
- `src/lib/` — `ApiClient`, `WalletManager`

---

## Wallet & Chain Interaction

The frontend is designed to integrate with the Stellar network through:

- Wallet connection via a Stellar-compatible wallet (stub in `src/lib/stellar.ts` — not yet connected)
- Read calls to Soroban contracts for vault state, streak verification, and yield data (not yet implemented)
- User-signed transactions for deposits, withdrawals, lending, borrowing, and vault creation (not yet implemented)

No private keys or signing authority touch frontend state — all signing will happen client-side via the user's connected wallet.

Fiat flows (Nigerian bank deposit/withdrawal) go through the backend's anchor-integration module. The frontend calls the backend via `ApiClient` in `src/lib/api.ts` — it never talks to the anchor partner directly.

---

## Development Notes

- This app currently targets **Phase 1** of the product roadmap. The vault and wallet hooks operate against local Zustand state — on-chain contract calls are stubbed.
- Feature modules in `src/features/lending/`, `src/features/borrowing/`, and `src/features/investments/` are structural scaffolds. Keep them **gated by feature flags** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_LENDING` etc.) in production builds until Phase 3.
- Yield, APY, and interest figures displayed in the UI must be sourced from on-chain contract data once integration is implemented — never hardcode or cache these values on the backend to preserve the "verifiable on-chain" differentiator.
- Shared types between frontend and backend live in `src/types/` for now. If the API surface grows significantly, consider moving them to a shared `packages/shared-types` workspace.
